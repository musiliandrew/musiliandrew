1. Styling Language

Markdown → the backbone for headings, lists, tables, images.

HTML inside Markdown → for fine-grained control (custom alignment, clickable images, centering).

CSS via inline HTML → minimal styling tricks (like image sizing).

SVGs → scalable, sharp graphics for banners and badges.

2. Visual Assets

Shields.io →
Creates custom badges for skills, tools, stats, downloads, etc.
Example:
    ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white)

Simple Icons →
Source of all the brand icons (React, Django, PostgreSQL, etc.).

Canva / Figma →
For creating custom banners, headers, or infographics.

Animated GIFs →
Small loops for personality (coding animation, blinking cursor).
