Customize README.md

Edit the README.md — this is what will show up at the top of your GitHub profile.

You can use:

Markdown (for headings, links, lists)

HTML (for more control over layouts)

Shields.io badges for skills and stats

Dynamic widgets like:

GitHub stats (github-readme-stats)

Activity graphs

Visitor counters

Spotify now-playing, YouTube latest videos, etc.

3. Add beauty & automation

Use Markdown styling for clean sections (About Me, Skills, Projects).

Pull in dynamic content using GitHub Actions:

Update latest blog posts

Show latest commits

Update “streak stats” automatically

Include SVG banners, animated GIFs, or ASCII art for flair.

4. Commit & watch the magic

Push changes → your profile instantly updates.

You can keep editing README.md anytime.
